## Introduction

Welcome to **દ્વીપBlogs**. Your privacy is important to me. This policy explains what information is collected when you visit this site and how it is used.

## 1. Information Collection (Google Analytics)

I use **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** to understand how visitors interact with my blog. This helps me see which posts are helpful and which topics I should write more about. 

GA4 collects data such as:
* Your general location (City/Country).
* The device and browser you are using.
* How long you stayed on a page.
* Which links you clicked.

**Note:** This data is anonymized and does not allow me to identify you personally. Google Analytics uses "cookies" to collect this data.

## 2. Hosting (AWS Amplify)

This site is hosted on **AWS Amplify**. Like most hosting providers, AWS logs basic technical information such as IP addresses and request timestamps for security and performance monitoring. These logs are stored on Amazon's secure servers.

## 3. Third-Party Links

My blog posts may contain links to external websites (like GitHub or project documentation). I am not responsible for the privacy practices of those external sites.

## 4. Your Choices

You can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by:
* Disabling cookies in your browser settings.
* Using a "Do Not Track" browser extension (like uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger).

## 5. Contact

If you have any questions about this policy, feel free to reach out to me via my GitHub.
